# F20DL Group 6 Portfolio

## This file explains the directories in this repository.

There are 2 main folders: Lab and CW

### The Lab Folder consists of 5 Labs:
1. Lab 1: Dataset Exploration on 3 datasets (Spotify Top Hit Playlist (2010-2022), Water Quality and Potability and MNIST).
2. Lab 2: Data Exploration & Visualization on previous 3 datasets by generating graphs.
3. Lab 3: Selected Spotify dataset and applied Feature Reduction and PCA.
4. Lab 4: Explored an image dataset called JMuBEN2 (Arabica coffee plantation leaves), applied pre-processing and normalization, trained a CNN model with 50 epochs and an SGD Classifier, and performed Evaluation Metrics on both models.
5. Lab 5: Instead of using CNN and SGD Classifier on the previous dataset, different types of Na√Øve Bayes Classifiers were trained on the dataset, and Evaluation Metrics were recorded.

### The CW folder consists of the Coursework - Part 1 Jupyter Notebook. Due to the dataset file sizes being huge, they couldn't be uploaded onto GitHub.
